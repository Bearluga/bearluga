		<p>Barney Steinson once said:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>
			God,
			I don't talk to you really often,
			but I do make some girls call your name,
			because of me.
		</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h3> First they came...</h3>
		<p id = "poem">First they came for the communists,<br />
			and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a communist.<br />
			Then they came for the trade unionists,<br />
			and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a trade unionist.<br />
			Then they came for the Jews,<br />
			and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a Jew.<br />
			Then they came for the Catholics,<br />
			and I didn't speak out because I was Protestant.<br />
			Then they came for me<br />
			and there was no one left to speak out for me.<br />
		</p>
